    2. Run the command "make clean"
    3. Run the command "make"
    4. Run the command "./main" with any number of threads. Example: ./main 4

WITH SYNCHRONIZATION:
    1. Edit the Makefile and add "-DPTHREAD_SYNC" as a compilation option. This line should go from "gcc -pthread -o main main.c" to "gcc -pthread -DPTHREAD_SYNC -o main main.c"
    2. Save the changes and exit the Makefile
    3. Run the command "make clean"
    4. Run the command "make"
